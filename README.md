### Database structure

###### Books
All of the rows in the "books" table of our database (library.sql) was either entered
through myor added through our website by an administrator. Because the data is entered manually,
we decided to have a relatively small number of books and limit the number of generes in order to
make testing more effecient and showcase our search functionality. However, new genres can be added easily
